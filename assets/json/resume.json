{"basics":{"name":"Luca Sala","label":"PhD","image":"","summary":"My work is focussed on the study of congenital and acquired cardiac arrhythmias with human and patient-specific in vitro models based on human induced pluripotent stem cells. With my research, I aim to to understand the complexity of genotype-phenotype relationships for cardiac arrhythmias and to use in vitro data to provide relevant information to clinicians for patient risk-stratification and precision medicine. To ultimately reduce the need of animals in pharmacological and toxicological research, I aim to optimise current drug screening platforms by using patient-specific human-based models and advanced hardware and software tools.","location":{"address":"Via Giuseppe Zucchi 18","postalCode":"20095","city":"Cusano Milanino (MI)","countryCode":"IT","region":"Lombardy"},"profiles":[{"network":"X","username":"luca__sala","url":"https://x.com/Luca__Sala"}]},"work":[{"name":"Department of Biotechnologies and Biosciences - University of Milano - Bicocca","position":"Assistant Professor of Physiology (RTD-A)","startDate":"2022-12-20","endDate":"today","summary":"Investigating the reasons behind incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in congenital Long QT Syndrome","highlights":[]},{"name":"Center for Cardiac Arrhythmias of Genetic Origin and Laboratory of Cardiovascular Genetics - Istituto Auxologico Italiano","supervisor":"Peter J Schwartz","position":"Affiliated Researcher","startDate":"2022-12-20","endDate":"today","summary":"Patient-specific disease model for congenital and acquired cardiac disorders","highlights":[]},{"name":"Department of Anatomy and Embryology - Leiden University Medical Center","supervisor":"Christine L Mummery","position":"Postdoctoral Fellow","startDate":"2015-02-01","endDate":"2017-12-31","summary":"","highlights":[]}],"education":[{"institution":"University of Milano - Bicocca","location":"Milan, Italy","url":"https://www.unimib.it/","area":"Long QT Syndrome modelled with human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSc)","studyType":"PhD in Molecular and Translational Medicine","startDate":"2011-11-01","endDate":"2014-12-12","score":""}],"skills":[{"name":"Stem Cell Biology","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-flask","keywords":["Human induced pluripotent stem cells","Cardiac Differentiation",""]},{"name":"Cellular Electrophysiology","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-bolt-lightning","keywords":["Patch Clamp","MultiElectrode Arrays","Dynamic Clamp","Ion Imaging"]},{"name":"Cardiology","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-heart","keywords":["Cardiac Arrhythmias","Channelopathies","Cardiomyopathies","Sudden Cardiac Death"]},{"name":"Software tools","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop-code","keywords":["MUSCLEMOTION","BAPTA","Python scripts","R scripts"]}],"languages":[{"language":"Italian","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}]}
