I work in the Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences of the University of Milano - Bicocca and I am affiliated researcher to the Center for Cardiac Arrhythmias of Genetic Origin and Laboratory of Cardiovascular Genetics of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano IRCCS.

My work is focussed on the study of congenital and acquired cardiac arrhythmias with human and patient-specific in vitro models based on human induced pluripotent stem cells.

I aim to to understand the complexity of genotype-phenotype relationships for congenital and acquired cardiac arrhythmias and to use in vitro data to provide relevant information to clinicians for patient risk-stratification and precision medicine, harnessing the power of machine learning and automation on biological data.

To ultimately reduce the need of animals in pharmacological and toxicological research, I aim to optimise current drug screening platforms by using patient-specific human-based models and advanced hardware and software tools.

In my free time, I like to code 👨🏻‍💻, ride my mountain bike 🚵🏻‍♂️ and run 🏃🏻.
