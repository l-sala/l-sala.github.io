I work in the center for Cardiac Arrhythmias of Genetic Origin and Laboratory of Cardiovascular Genetics of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano.

My work is focussed on the study of congenital and acquired cardiac arrhythmias with human and patient-specific in vitro models based on human induced pluripotent stem cells.

With my research, I aim to to understand the complexity of genotype-phenotype relationships for cardiac arrhythmias and to use in vitro data to provide relevant information to clinicians for patient risk-stratification and precision medicine.

To ultimately reduce the need of animals in pharmacological and toxicological research, I aim to optimise current drug screening platforms by using patient-specific human-based models and advanced hardware and software tools.

In my free time, I like to code 👨🏻‍💻, ride my mountain bike 🚵🏻‍♂️ and run🏃🏻.
